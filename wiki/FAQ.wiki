== Where are the games? ==

We do not distribute games with the 8-Bit-Hits emulator. You can upload ROM files from your computer by clicking on the "Import Game" link.

Why don't we distribute games? Because many games are still protected by copyright and distribution would get me in trouble. If you know of a way to legally distribute games (including purchasing valid copies through in-app purchases) i'm open to suggestions.

== How do I delete a game? ==

Right now you can't. Look for this feature in an upcoming release

== Where is the sound? ==

Right now sound doesn't work.

Google Chrome v13 does support sound generation, and we have begun working on this feature, however, it isn't ready for prime time. If you are a Java / GWT developer and are interested feel free to [Contributing join our open-source project].


== Why doesn't game XYZ work? ==

If you come across a Game that doesn't work please file a [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-nes-port/issues/list bug report]. Please include the name of the game and a detailed description of the incompatibility issues you are experiencing.
