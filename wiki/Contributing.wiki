I run this project in my spare time, and it is one of many open source projects I actively manage. There is a lot of work left to do, and I would really appreciate the help!

= Wish List =

The following areas need to be improved, and help would be very greatly appreciated: 
 * *Sound* using the HTML5 audio API
 * Improve performance, especially for the CR-48 users
 * Improve game compatibility and rendering(specifically Star Tropics)
 * Ability to Sync games from Chrome to Google Docs and back
