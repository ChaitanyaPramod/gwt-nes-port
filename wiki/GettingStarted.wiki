#summary Gettings started with NES and GWT

= Getting the Code =

You can checkout the code from our [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-nes-port/source/checkout Subversion Repository]. Currently we have two different eclipse projects available:
 * Emulator only
 * 8-bit-hits Application, includes the emulator, screens, game storage, etc

Note: you will need to include a copy of the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-mobile-webkit/ gwt-mobile-webkit] library, which is used to provide local storage for our games.

= Chrome Web Store =

In addition to the source code, you can download a free packaged version of the application, called [http://goo.gl/OQvYv 8-bit-hits], from the Chrome Web Store.

First, go to the [http://goo.gl/OQvYv 8-bit-hits page] in the Chrome Web Store and click the install button:
